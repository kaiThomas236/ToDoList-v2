# ToDoList-v2
A more complex version of the ToDoList project using MongoDB and Mongoose

Instructions: 

You can find this web app deployed at https://kaithomas-todolist.cyclic.app
(Please keep in mind that Cyclic is a completely free service, so my webapp runs a touch slow.)

At the root directory is your main To-Do List. I would use this for groceries, chores, and other day-to-day tasks. At https://kaithomas-todolist.cyclic.app/work is another To-Do List which I would use for work related tasks, such as meetings, deliverables, and watering your desk plant :).

You can add items, remove items, and cross items out. Have a go and let me know what you think!
